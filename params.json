The Brigade is about action and you're here because you are someone who takes action.\r\n\r\n### We're just getting started.\r\nApple was founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne on April 1, 1976. This fun fact has nothing to do with our Brigade, except we're officially launched this group exactly 40 years later.\r\n\r\n### We're looking for government partners around the lake.\r\nPlease reach out if your organization is interested in collaborating with us around technology-based civic projects. Bring your own project ideas or invite us to brainstorm with you.\r\n\r\n### Founding Members\r\n* Ben Damman (@typesend)\r\n* Matt McFarland\r\n* Jeffrey Booth (@Tahcoder)\r\n* Jamie Orr (@jamieforr)\r\n\r\n### For More Information\r\nEmail ben (dot) damman [@] gmail (dot) com",
